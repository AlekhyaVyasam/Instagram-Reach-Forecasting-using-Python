 Instagram Reach Forecasting :

  Instagram reach forecasting is the practise of predicting the amount of people who will see an Instagram post, story, or other content based on historical data and other factors.
  
  Predicting reach can be useful for content creators and anyone who uses Instagram professionally when planning and optimising their social media strategy. Creators can make informed decisions about when to publish, what types of content to generate, and how to engage their audience by evaluating how their material performs. It may result in higher engagement, improved performance indicators, and, ultimately, greater platform success.
